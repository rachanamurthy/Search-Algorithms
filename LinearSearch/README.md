# Linear Search

Linear Search Algorithm is perhaps the simplest algorithm to search for the given element in a list/array.

In Best Case, the complexity is O(1) --> when the required element is found in the first index.

In Worst Case, the complexity is O(n) --> when the whole list needs to be iterated over.
