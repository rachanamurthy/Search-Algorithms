# Implementation of Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search algorithm requires a sorted array as an input. This algorithm slices through the middle of the array to zero down the required element.

In the best case, the complexity of this Algorithm is O(1) -> when the required element is in the middle of the array.

In the worst case, the complexity of this Algorithm is O(log n)
